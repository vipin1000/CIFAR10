Summary:
Image classification is an important task in computer vision and CNNs have emerged as a powerful technique for this purpose. The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images in each class. Our aim in this study is to create a CNN model that can recognize these images and classify them according to their categories.

2. Dataset Description: The
CIFAR-10 dataset contains ten categories: Aircraft, Cars, Birds, Cats, Deer, Dogs, Frogs, Horses, Boats, and Cars.
The data is divided into a training set of 50,000 images and a test set of 10,000 images. In this process, all classes are equal.

3. Model Architecture: The
CNN architecture is designed for image classification. Row row row row row row row row row row row row row row row row row row row row row row row row row row row row row row row row row row row row row row row row line In order to increase the efficiency of the system, the operation of the system is carried out.
All layers at the end of the network are responsible for class prediction. Use regular processing techniques such as release and batch normalization to avoid overflows.

4. Training methods: Demonstrate the CNN training model using optimization methods such as
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. Adjust training throughout the training period and avoid a dysfunctional fit (eg.
For example, categorical cross-entropy) is used to reduce classification error. The training process includes repeated sessions and is optimized through competition.

5. Evaluation Metrics:
Evaluate the CNN model of the evaluation model using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Construct a confusion matrix to show the performance of the model of the various classes. Measure the model's ability to generalize and control different rooms.

6. Results and Discussion: Consider the effectiveness of the
CNN model as a benchmark. The accuracy of the test method's model can enable us to understand its full impact on the classification of images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.
